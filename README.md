What you need to know about each bookmarklet
=
Zoom Bookmarklet.txt: 
=
You can add this code as a bookmark in your browser's bookmarks toolbar and then click on it when you're on a webpage.

You can also customize the function to your needs, this is just a basic example.

Note that this approach may not be compatible with all browsers, and alternative approaches may be needed to achieve the same result in other browsers.
Also, keep in mind that the zoom level can be changed by the user via the settings and if the user changes the zoom level, the bookmarklet will not work anymore.


Force Darkmode.txt: 
=
You can add this code as a bookmark in your browser's bookmarks toolbar, and then click on it when you're on a webpage.

This bookmarklet uses JavaScript to create a new style element and add it to the head of the page. The CSS within the style element changes the background color and text color of all elements to a dark color scheme.

It's worth mentioning that this is a simplified example, and different website could have different css classes and ids which could make it difficult to force dark mode on all of them. However, this script can still be used as a starting point to make some changes to a website css.

Also, depending on the website, this may cause issues with certain elements that are not intended to be affected by this change, so you should use it carefully.


Tab Title Changer.txt: 
=
You can add this code as a bookmark in your browser's bookmarks toolbar, and then click on it when you're on a webpage.

This bookmarklet uses JavaScript to prompt the user to enter a new title, and then sets the document's title to the new title.

Keep in mind that this will only change the title of the tab, and it will not change the title of the webpage as it is shown in the website's HTML, this means that if you reload the page the title will go back to the original one.

Also, some website may have certain restrictions that could prevent you from changing the title, so you should check if it's possible to edit the title before using the bookmarklet.

YouTube Picture-In-Picture:
=
You can add this code as a bookmark in your browser's bookmarks toolbar, and then click on it when you're on a YouTube video page.

This bookmarklet uses JavaScript to find the first video element on the page and request Picture-in-Picture mode for it.

It's worth noting that this is a basic example, and it would work only if the website follows the same structure as YouTube. Also, the Picture-in-picture mode is a feature that is supported by the browser, and not all browsers support it, so in some cases the bookmarklet would not work.

It's also important to mention that this feature is enabled only on specific sites by default, and you need to give explicit permission to use the feature on other sites, so please make sure that the feature is enabled on the site you want to use the bookmarklet on.
